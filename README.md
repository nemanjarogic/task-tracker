## Development server

1. Run `ng serve` or `npm start` for a dev server.
2. Run `npm run server` to set up a json-server (that is used to imitate remote API).
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 

The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` or `ng g c component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
